excerpt: Getting Ubuntu installed and setting up applications.
---

I'd set aside a couple of days to get my laptop fully up and running; 
I hadn't had much Linux experience outside of Raspbian and thought it may have been 
challenging to get the tools I was used to setup and working together. I was very
happy to be proven wrong.

To get started, I grabbed the image of Ubuntu 16.04, burned it to a USB key and 
booted the machine into Ubuntu. After following the install steps through and 
unpinning everything from the Launcher that was attached, I was ready to start 
exploring!

Let's fast forward a couple of hours.

The laptop is now set up and running a test project I had configured on my 
Windows machine. The programs I have installed are:

    -   Git
    -   Terminator
    -   ZSH
    -   oh-my-zsh
    -   MySQL
    -   MyCLI
    -   PHP 5.6
    -   PHP 7.3
    -   Composer
    -   Node.js
    -   npm
    -   Supervisor
    -   VSCode
    -   Nginx
    -   Redis

I instantly feel like my productivity has increased with Terminator and Nginx alone.
Terminator giving me split screen tabs is phenomenal, as is the tab less I now require
from having a server run my applications instead of serving them via Artisan.

It's nice to also be able to use VSCode, Firefox and webpack without my computer 
freezing as well!
