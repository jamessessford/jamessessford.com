I'd set aside a couple of days to get my laptop fully up and running; 
I hadn't had much Linux experience outside of Raspbian and thought it may have been 
challenging to get the tools I was used to setup and working together. I was very
happy to be proven wrong.

To get started, I grabbed the image of Ubuntu 16.04, burned it to a USB Drive and 
booted the machine into Ubuntu. After following the install steps through and unpinning
everything from the Launcher that was attached, I was ready to start exploring!
