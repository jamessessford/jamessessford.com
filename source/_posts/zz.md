Mattias Geniar (@mattiasgeniar) posted a link in the past couple of days that I found really interesting:

[zz: a smart and efficient directory changer by Leah Neukirchen](https://leahneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2017/01/zz-a-smart-and-efficient-directory-changer.html)

Without spoiling the end - the article is definitely worth the read!! - I'm slowly managing to change my workflow to use ```zz``` to get to where I need to be instead of ```cd ../../../``` once I've navigated into a project.

Thanks Leah!
