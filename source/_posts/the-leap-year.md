excerpt: What's been going on the last two months.
---

February 29th 2020. A date that will never occur again, as time moves forward but 
never back, and a day we won't see again for four more years.

I've been fairly quiet the last couple of months as I've struggled to find things to  write about.

On my quests from <a href="/blog/i-spent-this-year-as-a-ghost/">my end of year list</a> 
I think I'm making quite steady progress. I've just finished a course of CBT and am trying to 
put into practice the techniques in how I personally review &amp; engage in the different aspects of my life.

Yesterday marked my last shift codng for <a href="http://atticusconsultancy.co.uk">Atticus Consultancy</a>. It's been a fantastic three years working there and I've got to work
on some fantastic projects and make some friends for life along the way!

Monday will be my first shift coding for <a href="https://preferredmanagement.co.uk">Preferred Management Solutions</a>. 

Today, I'm going to code for the joy of discovery.
