excerpt: Creating a package for a deck of cards

There are some changes to the core functionality described in the last post, but I took the ideas I was working on and created a package to represent the deck of cards for use in a Laravel application using Verbs.

The source is available [here](https://github.com/jamessessford/playing-cards).

If you're making games with PHP/Laravel/Verbs, I'd love to chat!
