excerpt: A template to speed up documentation writing with Ibis.
---

In my last post I described getting started with Ibis and how it was making writing documentation an easier task for me.

However, as with most tasks, I was looking for a way to improve my workflow with it and speed up the process and so built a template that I can use as the basis for all of the documentation I'm writing.

The main features of the template are the VS Code extension recommendations, allowing me to see the PDF from within VS Code rather than having to open the file in a separate reader, and the auto build task for Ibis when I'm updating content in the document.
