My general development environment on Windows consists of VSCode, Firefox, PHP, MySQL, Redis &amp; Node.

    -   VSCode for editing files
    -   PHP to serve the application (php artisan serve)
    -   MySQL and Redis running as background services
    -   Node running webpack or gulp
    -   Firefox to view the website
